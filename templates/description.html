<h2>Mini Project 2: Image Classification with a Custom CNN</h2>

<p>
This challenge is part of the Mini Project 2 assignment. Participants are required to
implement, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for an
image classification task. The dataset contains images grouped into class folders,
and the goal is to correctly classify each image into its corresponding category.
</p>


<p>
The challenge evaluates the participant’s trained model on a hidden test set.  
Your final score will be the <b>classification accuracy</b> computed on this test set.
</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understand convolution, activation functions, pooling, and fully connected layers.</li>
  <li>Implement forward and backward propagation (NumPy version only).</li>
  <li>Train a CNN and apply basic hyperparameter tuning.</li>
  <li>Evaluate model performance based on accuracy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This challenge simulates a real-world machine learning workflow, emphasizing both
implementation correctness and model performance.
